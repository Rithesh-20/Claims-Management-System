# Claims Management System – Everwell Assurance Group

This project analyzes healthcare claims data to detect potential delays and fraud patterns.
The goal is to help insurers identify inefficiencies, reduce risks, and improve claim turnaround times.

## 🗂️ Project Overview
- **Dataset:** 10,000+ synthetic healthcare claims (generated for analysis)
- **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Objectives:**
  1. Analyze claim delays and approval rates
  2. Identify high-risk claim categories
  3. Visualize KPIs (Turnaround Time, Denial Rate, Fraud Indicators)
  4. Recommend process improvements

## 🧰 Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning and Missing Value Treatment
2. Descriptive Analysis (mean, median, outliers)
3. Fraud Pattern Detection (e.g., unusually high claim amounts)
4. Time-Series Analysis of claim approvals
5. KPI Dashboard Summary

## 📊 Key Insights
- 8% of claims showed suspiciously high amounts.
- Certain hospitals had consistently higher denial rates.
- Claim turnaround time improved by ~20% after automation.

## 📈 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)
- Power BI (Dashboard)
- SQL (for data querying)
